<h4>Email Template</h4>
<p>The service can sends emails using a set of string parameters, e.g. subject, body etc. However, it can also send emails based on an HTML&nbsp;template.</p>
<p>The two main areas are the &lsquo;subject&rsquo; and &lsquo;body&rsquo; tags which correspond to the parts of the email.&nbsp; You can also use the basic HTML styling accepted in HTML based emails e.g. bold, underling etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;subject&gt;The Work Item [@@System.ID@@] has been edited&lt;/subject&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>The title is '@@System.Title@@' for the work item [@@System.ID@@] &lt;br /&gt;<br>My custom field is '@@Bm.CustomField1@@' and this field should give an error '@@Incorrect.Field@@' <br>&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Any work item fields between @@markers@@ will replaced with the actual values from the TFS work item, any fields between ##markers##&nbsp; will be replaced by the values from the alert event XML block. You can also append a list of all the field values using
 the dump field flags</p>
